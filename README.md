# Trending Britain
Collecting, visualising and discussing UK / British data

## Aims

The aims of this project are to make a website (or something similar) that brings together and visualises lots of data about the state of Britain over time. It will look at things like:

 -  inequality (gini index)
 -  house prices
 -  the prison population
 -  GDP/growth
 -  unemployment
 -  inflation
 -  crime
 -  debt
 -  etc., etc.

As well as visualising the data with graphs, we can use maps to show how different regions have fared over time.

Hopefully, this will provide some reasonably reliable evidence for how well different governments tend to do on a range of different issues.

## How do I get involved?

Firstly, clone this github project so that you can add to it. If you're not part of the MASS group but would like to contribute, let [Nick](mailto:n.s.malleson@leeds.ac.uk) know.

Then, think of some data that you would like to include. Once you've found it, add it to the [data](./data) folder and start to analyse it. Have a look at what is already there, although at this stage it's pretty piecemeal.

After that,  ... , well, I'm not really sure. I'm looking at writing some D3 code that will visualise the different data sources, but better ideas are most welcome!  

**For more info, see the Wiki (_Nick hasn't gotten round to sorting this out yet, but will do asap.._)**
