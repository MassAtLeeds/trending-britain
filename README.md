# Trending Britain
Collecting, visualising and discussing British data

_First ToDo: Project needs a better name!!!_

## Aims

The aims of this project are to make a website (or something similar) that brings together and visualises lots of data about the state of Britain over time. It will look at things like:

 -  inequality (gini index)
 -  house prices
 -  the prison population
 -  GDP/growth
 -  unemployment
 -  inflation
 -  crime
 -  debt
 -  etc., etc.

As well as visualising the data with graphs, we can use maps to show how different regions have fared over time.

Hopefully, this will provide some reasonably reliable evidence for how well different governments tend to do on a range of different issues.
