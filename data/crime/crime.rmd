Graph of national crime over time:

```{r national_crime_graph }
# Read the crime data and then take out entries with NA (survey didn't happen every year)
crime <- read.csv("national_crime_1981-2014.csv")
crime <- d[!is.na(d$CSEWCrime),]

# Find out who was in government in each year
govt <- read.csv("../party_summary-1945-2015.csv")

# Now plot the government on the x axis, represented by a coloured line
